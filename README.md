# Template Project

This is a template repository for a simple Python project with a basic DevOps environment.

## Folder Description

Here's a brief explanation of each folder:

**config**: Configuration files, such as YAML or JSON, that store project settings.

**data**: Input and output data. For example, raw data could go in the input folder, and processed or generated data could go in the output folder.

**logs**: Log files generated by your application.

**models**: Saved machine learning models or any other serialized models.

**src**: Source code of your project.

## Configuration

The project uses a configuration file named `config_file.yml`. Adjust the settings as needed.

## Source Code

The main source code is located in the `src` folder. The entry point is `main_module.py`, which prints "Hello World".

## Tests

Unit tests are located in the `tests` folder. Run tests using `pytest`.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. It runs tests on every push to the `main` branch.

## Docker

The project can be containerized using Docker. The `Dockerfile` specifies the container configuration.

## Dependencies

The project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Comunity

Feel free to modify and extend this template for your specific needs.
